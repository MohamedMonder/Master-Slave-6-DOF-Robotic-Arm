# Master-Slave-6-DOF-Robotic-Arm-
There are two robotic arm one of them are the master to control other which is the slave.

Which the master is a small 6 DOF robotic arm consist of 6 potentiometers 
And the slave is a big 6 DOF robotic arm also consist of 6 servo motors

by using 2 Bluetooth Module HC-05 and you have to use AT command to set one as a master and the other as a slave as in this link
http://www.instructables.com/id/AT-command-mode-of-HC-05-Bluetooth-module/

The components are:

1) 6 potentiometers
2) 6 servo motors
3) 2 Bluetooth Module HC-05
4) 2 Arduino Uno or any other type
5) Battery with high dischage rate for servo motors
6) 2 breadboard
7) wires
